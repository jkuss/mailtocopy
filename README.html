<h1>mailtocopy</h1>

<p>jQuery Plugin to allow click or copy/paste of email address in HTML</p>

<p>Its goal is to allow users to click mail links to use their device&rsquo;s native email client OR copy addresses to use a web-based client easily. If you write your mailto link as normal and add a class, you can call <code>mailtocopy()</code> on that class using jQuery. The raw link continues to function and doesn&rsquo;t disrupt the flow of the paragraph or other inline elements.</p>

<p>This plugin handles all standard options on the mailto link (multiple addresses, subject lines, etc.) There are no options, CSS is added to the <code>&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;</code>. The default CSS disables the plugin functionality on devices smaller than 768px wide (&lt; desktop). This prevents hovers from overriding clicks on mobile devices and most people use the native email client on their mobile device anyway. Override CSS as you wish.</p>
